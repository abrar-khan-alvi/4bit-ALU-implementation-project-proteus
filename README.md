# 4bit-ALU-implementation-project-proteus
This repository contains the implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Proteus. 
The ALU is a digital circuit capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit binary numbers.
This project serves as a practical example for understanding and simulating ALU functionality within the Proteus environment.
